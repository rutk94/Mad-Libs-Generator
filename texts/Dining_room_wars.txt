Our dining [NOUN] used to be a war [NOUN].
I thought the battles about correct table [PLURAL_NOUN] would
never end. It was us kids versus Mom, and it seemed like a fight
that would last to the [ADJECTIVE] end. But tonight Dad finally
declared a/an [ADJECTIVE] truce, and we negotiated a/an
[ADJECTIVE] peace [NOUN]. Mom promised to no l
onger get [ADVERB] upset and shoot us dirty [PLURAL_NOUN]
and make [ADJECTIVE] remarks when we do [ADJECTIVE]
things she doesn't like. We in turn agreed to:
	1) Use napkins to wipe our [PART_OF_THE_BODY] and not
	our [PLURAL_NOUN],
	2) Keep our [PART_OF_THE_BODY_PLURAL] off the table,
	3) Not use our [PART_OF_THE_BODY_PLURAL] to pick up [PLURAL_NOUN]
	from our plates - except for sanwiches or pieces of [NOUN],
	4) Never talk with food in our [PART_OF_THE_BODY_PLURAL].
